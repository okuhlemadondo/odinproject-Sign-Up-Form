# Sign Up Form (The Odin Project)

## Overview

Welcome to the Sign-Up Form project repository! This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum and showcases a simple, yet well-designed sign-up form for an imaginary service. The form demonstrates the use of modern HTML and CSS techniques, focusing on layout, form design, and basic validation.

## Features

Responsive Layout: While this project isn’t yet optimized for mobile devices, the desktop layout is carefully structured to provide a clean and accessible user experience.

#### Custom Styling:

Background image selection with a semi-transparent overlay behind the logo for enhanced readability.
Consistent design elements, including color schemes and font choices, to create a cohesive look.

#### Interactive Form Elements:

Styled input fields with visual feedback for focus, invalid states, and more.
A custom-styled "Create Account" button that matches the overall design.

## Technologies Used

HTML5: Semantic HTML is used to structure the form and page content.
CSS3: Modern CSS techniques, including pseudo-classes like :invalid and :focus, are utilized for styling and form validation.
